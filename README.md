# Fintoc -> Actual Budget

This tool is designed to help you manage your finances by integrating [Fintoc](https://fintoc.com/) with [Actual Budget](https://actualbudget.org). It allows you to fetch transactions from Fintoc and import them into Actual Budget.

## Prerequisites
- Node.js installed on your machine.
- A Fintoc account with access to your bank transactions via their API.
  - You need to create a Fintoc API key and link your bank account to Fintoc.
  - You can find instructions on how to do this in the [Fintoc documentation](https://docs.fintoc.com/).
  - Save your Fintoc API key in a `.env` file in the root of the project. The same for the Fintoc Link Tokens.
  - KEEP THEM SECRET! Do not share them with anyone or commit them to version control.
- An Actual Budget app running on your machine.
  - You can find instructions on how to do this in the [Actual Budget documentation](https://actualbudget.org/docs/).

# Notes
- I barely know any JavaScript or Node, so this code was done with a lot of help from Copilot (vibecoding vibes only 🤙).
